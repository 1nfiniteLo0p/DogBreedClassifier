# DogBreedClassifier

A machine learning model to classify different dog breeds from images. This project was created as part of my personal journey through the fastai deep learning course, aimed at enhancing my skills and understanding of the Fastai API. The model is trained on the [Stanford Dogs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset), and it can accurately identify 120 dog breeds based on visual features. This repository contains code for training, evaluating, and deploying the model, along with a link to the dataset of dog images.

Features:

- Pre-trained deep learning models for dog breed classification.
- Support for transfer learning to improve model accuracy.
- Easy-to-use scripts for training and evaluating models.
- Instructions for deploying the model using popular frameworks.
- Sample dataset for quick setup and testing.
